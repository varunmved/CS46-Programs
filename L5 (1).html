<p>In this assignment you will be working with standard input, standard output, and outputting to files.</p>
<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Update your VM to get the latest packages needed for this assignment.</p>
<pre>$ <strong>appliance upgrade all</strong></pre>
<h2>Fork and Clone the Repository</h2>
<p>You will use Git and BitBucket to both start and submit the project. The first step is to fork the starter repository on BitBucket, then clone it into your virtual machine.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into BitBucket and go to the repository at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/profbbrown/lab-5-files">https://bitbucket.org/profbbrown/lab-5-files</a></li>
<li><strong>Fork the repository.</strong> Click on the three dots in the left sidebar and select Fork. On the next screen, check the box labeled "private repository" and click Fork Repository. This will create a copy of my repository in your BitBucket account.</li>
<li><strong>Clone the repository.</strong> Click the three dots in your new (forked) repository and select Clone. Copy the command out of the box.</li>
<li>Go to your VM and paste the command. This will pull a copy of your BitBucket repository to your VM. It will automatically create a directory to hold the working directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will now have a directory containing two files: <strong>homelistings.csv</strong> and <strong>homes200.csv</strong>. The first file contains 9977 homes for sale in Sacramento and Placer counties. The second file is 200 random lines from the first file. You can use the smaller file for testing with a smaller set of homes.</p>
<p>Each line of the file consists of the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>zip code</li>
<li>ID</li>
<li>address</li>
<li>price</li>
<li>number of beds</li>
<li>number of baths</li>
<li>area</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem 1: Convert to JSON</h2>
<p>In this program you will convert the CSV file to JSON. Only the ZIP code, address, price, and area will be in the JSON file. It will look like this:</p>
<pre>[
{ "zip": 95678, "address": "123 Main St.", "price": 234000, "area": 1700 },<br />{ "zip": 95815, "address": "1000 Elm St.", "price": 250000, "area": 1500 },
...
{ "zip": 95677, "address": "222B Baker", "price": 399000, "area": 1850 }
]</pre>
<p>Your program, contained in&nbsp;<strong>homes2json.c</strong>, will read from standard input and write to standard output. You can run it like this:</p>
<pre>./homes2json &lt; homelistings.csv &gt; homes.json</pre>
<p>After running the program, you can view the resulting JSON file to see that it has the correct format. Things to watch for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attribute names (zip, address, price, and area) must be in quotes.</li>
<li>The address itself must also be in quotes.</li>
<li>There is no comma after the last home.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Did you produce valid JSON?</h4>
<p>The <strong>jsonlint</strong> program can tell you if you have a properly formatted JSON file. Run it like this:</p>
<pre>$ <strong>jsonlint -v homes.json</strong></pre>
<p>If it says "ok", great! But if not, it will tell you where you have a problem.</p>
<h2>Problem 2: Calculate Home Prices</h2>
<p>Write a program in <strong>homeprice.c</strong> that calculates three values: the cheapest home, the most expensive home, and the average price of all homes. Your program doesn't need to actually open any files for reading. Just get input using scanf like you always have and run the program using redirection:</p>
<pre>./homeprice &lt; homelistings.csv</pre>
<p>Your program should output just the three numbers separated by a space each and terminated with a newline. Only three integers. No extra output.</p>
<p>Running the program on the homes200.csv file should produce the following output:</p>
<pre>./homeprice &lt; homes200.csv
59900 8000000 416579</pre>
<h2>Problem 3: Small, medium, large</h2>
<p>Read the homelistings.csv file from standard input using the techniques we learned in class and in the textbook. You will write the data to three files: <strong>small.txt</strong>, <strong>med.txt</strong>, and <strong>large.txt</strong>.</p>
<p>A small home is less than 1000 sq ft. A medium home is 1000-2000 sq ft. And a large home is more than 2000 sq ft.</p>
<p>To each file, write the address and area of the home, separated by a colon, like this:</p>
<pre>123 Main St. : 1734<br />7842 Sunset Blvd. : 3910</pre>
<p>Verify your program is working by inspecting each of the output files using an editor. Make sure the areas of all the homes in the small.txt file are less than 1000 sq ft, all the homes in the med.txt file are between 1000 and 2000 (inclusive), etc.</p>
<p>The name of this program should be <strong>sml.c</strong> (stands for small-medium-large).</p>
<h2>Problem 4: Zip codes</h2>
<p>Segregate the homes by zip code. Write a program to create a text file for each zip code in the file. For example, if the zip codes 12345, 95678, and 34872 are in the file, you should end up with three files: <strong>12345.txt</strong>, <strong>95678.txt</strong>, and <strong>34872.txt</strong>.</p>
<p>The input file is read from standard input, as shown in the textbook.</p>
<p>To each file just write the addresses of the homes.</p>
<p>The name of this program should be <strong>zips.c</strong></p>
<h2>What to Turn In</h2>
<p>To turn in these programs, commit them to your local repo and push them to BitBucket. The commands are:</p>
<pre>$ <strong>git add homes2json.c</strong>
$ <strong>git add homeprice.c</strong>
$ <strong>git add sml.c</strong>
$ <strong>git add zips.c</strong>
$ <strong>git commit</strong>
$ <strong>git push</strong></pre>
<p>But do not wait until the end of the assignment to do these steps. At the very least commit your programs as you finish each one. Ideally, commit them every time you have something that compiles and works well enough to take a snapshot of.</p>
